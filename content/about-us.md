# About Us

Jews for Freedom is a new collaborative effort bringing Jews together to secure our democracy. Led by partner organizations and energized by many more Jewish social justice groups, we energize and amplify collective actions to bring more Jews into the fight for democracy and against authoritarian power grabs.

## Who’s involved

Jews for Freedom is an initiative of **Powered By Faith**. Our partners include:

- Bend the Arc - a partnership for justice
- Collaborative for Jewish Organizing
- the Jewish Social Justice Roundtable
- Jews United for Justice
- Religious Action Center and the Union for Reform Judaism

Together we are responding to a call for faith communities in the U.S. to address the crisis of authoritarianism and the urgency of securing our democracy.
