# About Us

Jews for Freedom is an initiative of Powered By Faith. [Link or description of PBF]. Our partners include Bend the Arc, Collaborative for Jewish Organizing, the Jewish Social Justice Roundtable, Jews United for Justice, and the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism. Together we are responding to a call for faith communities in the U.S. to address the crisis of authoritarianism - and democracy - that we are all facing. 

Many Jewish organizations and congregations are engaged in this work. We exist to collaborate and network with each other and other faith communities for maximum impact. Our hope is that many more will join us, ranging from other organizations to motivated individuals and everything - and everyone - in between.

We are in a time of crisis. Now is the time to do something about it. This is what we are doing:

- Organizing our Jewish leaders — rabbis, lay leaders, influencers, organizers, activists — with non-Jewish partners, standing together in support of democracy and against authoritarianism.
- Enlisting and organizing a critical mass of Jews deeply engaging in a range of meaningful actions that have an impact in their communities and across the country.
- Demonstrating for all to see a visible presence of Jews striving to secure our democratic future, through religious and civic action in our communities and earned media.

If you represent an organization and want to join, learn more, or talk about working together, [let us know here](#). If you have already signed up to our Call to Action, you will be hearing from us shortly.
