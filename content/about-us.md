Jews for Freedom is a new collaborative effort bringing communities together to secure our democracy. Many Jewish synagogues and organizations are already taking action. Our mission is to strengthen those efforts and bring new people into this work.  

We are in a time of crisis. Now is the time to do something about it.

## Who’s involved

Jews for Freedom is an initiative of Powered By Faith. Our partners include Bend the Arc - a partnership for justice, Collaborative for Jewish Organizing, the Jewish Social Justice Roundtable, Jews United for Justice, and the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism. Together we are responding to a call for faith communities in the U.S. to address the crisis of authoritarianism and the urgency of securing our democracy.
