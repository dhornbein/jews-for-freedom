# Together We Must Defend Our Freedoms

A number of prominent Jewish organizations have joined forces to stem the tide of rising authoritarianism in the U.S. Please add your name to our statement and get ready to take collective action as Jews and as citizens:

The modern miracle of Jewish acceptance and success in the U.S. is a direct result of our democratic rights and freedoms. It is in this soil that Americans of all faiths, races, and national origin came together to expand those rights from a select few to all of us. This was not the result of divine intervention; it is a consequence of struggle. And we are justifiably proud of the extensive and notable involvement of Jewish Americans in those struggles.

Right now many of those hard fought for achievements are at risk because of the actions and policies of the Trump administration. Our country is dramatically off-kilter right now and we’re called to make it right. And in keeping with our history, both ancient and modern, we won’t just curse the darkness; we are going to shine a light - the light of freedom. Together, we are Jews for Freedom.

We know in our bones what happens when people with power try to dismantle democratic rights and protections. It is time for Jews everywhere to stand up for freedom, against authoritarianism, and for democracy for all.
