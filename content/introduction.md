Major Jewish organizations and individuals are launching a full-throated and widespread Jewish resistance to authoritarianism as part of a broader multi-faith effort. The overall resistance is occurring across all lines of difference, including race, gender, class, financial status, sexual
orientation, age, ability, and religion. Showing up as Jews, as individuals and as communities, is part of a long-standing tradition we are proud of.

We know first hand what happens when laws are treated as optional or put in place to target minorities. Many Jews are experiencing this current moment through generational trauma rooted in our history with authoritarian regimes and antisemitism. These experiences have led some Jews to turn inward and be silent, others to lean towards those with power in a misguided hope of protection. As Jews, we must reject the way claims of antisemitism are being manipulated to undermine the rule of law and instead stand up, resist, and demand that democracy work for all.
